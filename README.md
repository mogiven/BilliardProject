## Scenes

There are mainly two scenes, UI scene (demo) and billiard scene (playground)

The UI scene is the start interface.

The billiard scene is the main playing scene.

## Implemented Requirements

This game is a billiards game based on Unity, targeting users who like billiards sports, especially those who want to experience real billiards operations on their computers. Users can control the character in the first-person perspective, holding a cue in their hands, and use the mouse and keyboard to hit the ball and move. This game implements the following functions:

* When the user holds down the right mouse button, the view is zoomed in by 3 times, and you can see the position and direction of the ball more clearly.
* When the user clicks the left mouse button, enter the hitting mode for 3 seconds. In these 3 seconds, the user can control the movement of the rod according to the up and down movement of the mouse, thereby adjusting the force.
* When the ball goes into the hole, the corresponding ball of the same color will light up with special effects, indicating that the ball of that color has been hit in. At the same time, the TV will show the current score.
* There will be sound effects and special effects when hitting the ball, increasing realism and fun.
* There will be fireworks effects and UI prompts when winning or losing, giving users feedback and rewards.
* Users can press the H key to call up the help interface and check the rules and operation instructions of the game.
* Users can press the R key to restore all positions of billiards to their initial values and restart the game.

The highlights of this game are:

* Adopted a first-person perspective, giving users a immersive feeling.
* Provided functions such as zooming in and hitting mode, allowing users to control the details of hitting more accurately.
* Added elements such as sound effects, special effects and TV, enhancing the atmosphere and fun of the game.
* Provided help interface and reset function, convenient for users to learn and restart the game.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

The advantages of this program are:

* The interface is simple and clear, and easy to understand.
* The logic is clear and reasonable, in line with the rules and physical principles of billiards sports.
* The effects are rich and colorful, improving user experience and satisfaction.

The disadvantages of this program are:

* The function is relatively single, with only one mode and one difficulty level.
* The interaction is relatively simple, without considering user needs such as  pausing games, saving progress, etc.
* The compatibility is poor, without adapting to different resolutions, different operating systems, different input devices, etc.

## How to Improve

In order to make this program more perfect and optimized, you can consider the following improvement directions:

* Add more modes and difficulty options, such as double-player battle, timing mode, random layout, etc., to give users more choices and challenges.
* Add more interactive functions, such as, adding pause, save, load buttons, supporting voice control or gesture input methods etc., giving users more freedom and convenience.
* Add more compatibility tests and adaptation work, such as adjusting interface layout according to different resolutions, optimizing performance according to different operating systems, adjusting operation methods according to different input devices etc., allowing users to play games smoothly on different platforms and devices.
